          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>I am a full stack software engineer who is recently graduated from Hackbright Academy. Before Hackbright, I studied both design in University of Arts London and economics in Istanbul University. Prior to that I worked as an Operations and Chartering Deputy Manager in tanker shipping business, focussing on voyage calculations, operations, and chartering negotiations. After working for several years, I realized that the key points of my job were problem-solving and database building. After moving to South Bay, I was quickly inspired by the potential of programming and began to take online programming courses. At this point I decided to take my passion one step further by attending Hackbright. After Hackbright, I am excited to combine my design and creativity skills with my engineering skills.
